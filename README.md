## Brief
The project will involve concepts from all core training modules; more specifically, this must:

The application must:

Be deployed to a Virtual Machine for testing

Be deployed in a managed Kubernetes Cluster for production

Make use of a managed Database solution

### Application
The application is a Flask application running in 2 micro-services (frontend and backend).
The database directory is available should you:

want to use a MySQL container for your database at any point, or

want to make use of the Create.sql file to set up and pre-populate your database.

The application works by:

The frontend service making a GET request to the backend service.
The backend service using a database connection to query the database and return a result.
The frontend service serving up a simple HTML (index.html) to display the result.

## Project Progress
I have attached images of my Jiira Board on: https://github.com/Scottynic112/flaskAppProjectResources. This was one of  the requirements of my project. I used Jira to track my requirements and progress. 

The board has been designed to be simple. Considering I want my plans to be clear I didn't want a cluttered board.
* *To Do*
   A list of requirements and tasks set out in the brief that I need to complete in order for this to be a successful project.
* *In Progress*
   Once the element has had any code written or a design created for it... Basically exists in any way, it is placed in the 'In progress' list.
* *Future Improvements*
   Any ideas or changes I would make if I were to do the project again.
* *Done*
   Once the task is finished then I place it into 'Done'.
